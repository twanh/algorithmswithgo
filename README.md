# Algorithms with GO!
> Learning about GO and Algorithms at the same time :) 

## Why?
This is a side project in which I attempt to write some algorithms in go. 
These algorithms are not really meant to be used, or be the most efficient possible.  
The main purpose is for me to learn Go and refresh my knowledge of Algorithms (and datastructures).
